## About me

Born to be a coder. I wrote Hello World first time when I was 14 and now I can write it in C, C++, Java, Javascript, python, visual basic, C# and still learning new ways to write it. :)
When I am not coding you can find me playing Badminton, Table tennis, Carrom, and Chess.
I turn into a philospher after few drinks and can debate you on the Life, Death, Happiness, sprituality etc.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Suraj-Kumar/suraj-kumar.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
